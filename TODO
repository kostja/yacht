Milestone 1 "Minimal":

done * print unidiff to the output
done * tabular result output
done * pattern recognition for the command line 1h,
done * colored output 4h
* start and shutdown a single scylla instance 4h
* --uri option: command line and config file
* update readme  2h

Milestone 2 "Useful to others":

* --start-and-exit
* --suite option
* test case support within a test file (aka harness commands),
* disable/enable test cases/file in suite.yaml
* print server log on failure
* greplog harness command

Milestone 3 "Sufficient for LWT":

* suite configuration file, server option:
    * 3-node cluster topology
    * 6-node 2-dc cluster topology
* harness: stop node, start node, restart node
* harness: remove node
* harness: replace node

Nice to have:
* delimiter: allow to set a delimiter of CQL commands for multi-line
  commands
* output filter: allow to set a filter (regular expression) to
  transform the output, to clean it from noise
* randomize lane name with a character or two
